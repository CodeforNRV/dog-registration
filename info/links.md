Angular seems quite nice.  Let's build it as an angular app, so it can work also nicely on phones/small screens.

let's use formly for angular 2+:

dropdown css styling github issue:
https://github.com/formly-js/ngx-formly/issues/1100

this looks nice:
https://ngx-bootstrap-latest.surge.sh/#/

bootstrap themes w forms:

NOT UP TO DATE:

dog tag landing page:

dog tag order form:
https://www.montgomerycountyva.gov/filestorage/16277/16895/17504/dog-tag-order-form-2018.pdf

the next step is to add our images of dogs.  Then we can throw it up on GitHub.

the next step is to get bootstrap-formly properly configured.  Currently we have bootstrap, but we haven't hooked the css up to formly fully, so certain things like drop-downs are not normalized.

gameplan:
argon works, although it's annoying that the scss files have to sit in the src directory.  Perhaps that can be fixed.






Optional:
file upload
disable or hide fields
