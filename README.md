Angular seems quite nice.  Let's build it as an angular app, so it can work also nicely on phones/small screens.

let's use formly for angular 2+:
https://github.com/formly-js/ngx-formly


bootstrap themes w forms:
https://demos.creative-tim.com/argon-design-system/index
https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly-templates-bootstrap
https://alligator.io/angular/formly/

the next step is to add our images of dogs.  Then we can throw it up on GitHub.

the next step is to get bootstrap-formly properly configured.  Currently we have bootstrap, but we haven't hooked the css up to formly fully, so certain things like drop-downs are not normalized.

gameplan:
FIRST try argon.
THEN try angular-formly-templates-bootstrap
