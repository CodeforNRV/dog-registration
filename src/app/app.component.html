	<h1>Application for Dog License</h1>

	Veterinarians are required to notify localities when a dog is vaccinated for rabies. If the dog doesn’t have a current Montgomery County dog license, then you need to purchase one. If not purchased within 90 days of vaccination date, the Treasurer will send the owner an Application for Dog License. If after 30 days of notice, the owner still has not purchased a dog license, the Treasurer shall notify animal control that an owner is in possession of a vaccinated animal without a current dog license.

	<br /><br />IMPORTANT: State Law requires that all dogs FOUR (4) MONTHS OLD OR OLDER must have a certificate of rabies vaccination signed by the veterinarian with the veterinarian’s license number and expiration date of the vaccination. Please complete and return this form to purchase the required DOG licenses.

	<br /><br />**FOR EACH LICENSE PURCHASED, A CURRENT ORIGINAL CERTIFICATE OF RABIES VACCINATION MUST BE PRESENTED.**  Dog license must be fastened to a collar and worn by the dog. If a tag is lost or destroyed, apply for a duplicate tag immediately by presenting the original receipt to the Treasurer’s Office.
